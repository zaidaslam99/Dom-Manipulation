<!--  
    So we talked about DOM token list but overall this code is similar to the other code that we wrote however there is something 
    that we need to know notice that in the div there is a class called mystyle and what we are doing is that we are removing the 
    myStyle class from the class token list.

    So here we need to know we are doing the same thing but notice that at the id we already have the class but we are still using 
    the DOM to access the tag and all we are doing is using the classList and then using remove and removing the class that is there
    thus doing this will happen once we press the button that is something to be aware of here.
