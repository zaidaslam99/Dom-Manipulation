<!-- 
    So here we are going to be working with classList something to know is that the classList property 
    returns the CSS classnames of an element The classList returns a DOMTokenList so in this code we have a 
    style tag and in it we are going to be having .myStyle class with the background-color and padding 
    we then have the body tag in it there is h1 and h2 then there is a button with the onclick function 
    that is going to be myFunction this is going to run when the button is clicked then there is a p tag 
    then there is a div tag with the id called myDIV and in that div we are going to have the p tag 
    then there is script tag with the function that we defined and its going to be storing a variable 
    called list that is using a getElementById and its going to refer to the myDIV notice that we are 
    using classList one thing I noticed is that we are using classList.

    Now when it comes to classList what it is an array with object classes that we are storing and something 
    new that I learned was that the reason why we have multiple classes is because they are universal traits 
    that don't hold onto one value rather they can be used interchangeably as suppose as one at a time 
    the other thing that we need to know is that id are used as single id card and are constant while class 
    are not there can be many classes so here we are getting the id using that and then running the classList 
    and then adding the myStyle class to the class token list.
    
    Something really important to understand is that the myFunction is going to run after the button has been 
    clicked so what we are doing is once clicked we are adding the myStyle to the token list and once doing so 
    that is going to change our div because that is what our class is oriented towards notice in the myDiv there 
    is no class there what we are doing is using classList to modify the DOM and once we modify the values such as 
    the DOM Token list and we are adding classes.
