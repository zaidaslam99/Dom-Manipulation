<!-- ___________________________________ NOTES ON CODES ABOVE ________________________________________________________________________________________ -->
<!-- 
    So here its important to summarize that out HTML each subset value is a node it 
    starts off with the html tag and then it breaks to head and then body. Then within the 
    head there is the title node and then there is string node. When it comes to the body 
    there is the ul node and there is the li node and there is the text node after that. 
 -->

<!-- 
    Root node

    console.log(document.documentElement);

    Here this is showing what the document is referring to and in this case its going to be 
    HTML here.
  -->

<!-- 
    Children node
    
    console.log(document.body.childNodes);

    Something worth mentioning here is that we are looking at the childNodes of the body 
    and in it when we get to the console that were we get the #text "\n    " so the array 
    is going to be this [#text , ul , #text , script] I have a couple of theory as to why 
    this happening here the first being that notice the text "\n    " there are 4 spaces here I 
    think that this has to do with indent amount here then there is the tag of the ul and then 
    space then script.
  -->

<!-- 
    firstChild & lastChild nodes

    So here there is an important thing to understand here and that being the first child is going 
    to be giving the tab space and the one with the firstElementChild is going to be giving the element 
    tag itself that is something to be aware of here
 -->

<!-- 
    console.log(tableTag.tBodies[0].rows[0].cells[0].textContent);
    
    So there is something to mention here the first thing that we need to know is 
    that we are working with tables here and the way to get to tables is similar and 
    different compared to using regular tags syntax so here we are using the tableTag then
    we are using the tBodies[0] then rows[0] then cells[0] then textContent so to get to 
    one of the tables what we are going to be doing is accessing the table body then the 
    table row and then table data and then table content that is something to be aware of here.
 -->

<!-- 
    ID Manipulation
    
    <ul id="element">
    
    element.style.background = "red";    

    So here the thing that I wanted to mention was that the word element is going to be 
    the id that we had created and using that id what we can do is run the css right on it 
    and notice we are calling the style tag and then changing the background color to red 
    and doing this we can modify the color of the id element to red this is essentially dom 
    manipulation

    const ulTag = document.getElementById("element");
    ulTag.style.backgroundColor = "blue";
    console.log(ulTag);

    Something that I wanted to mention was that we can modify the classes directly and what else 
    we can do is use the getElementById and then call the id and save to variable and then modify 
    it directly as well.
-->

<!-- 
    
    listItem = document.getElementsByClassName("list-item");
    console.log(listItem);

    console.log(document.getElementsByTagName("table"));

    So here the important thing to understand is that we are using the getElementByClassName and 
    we are accessing the class in this case its going to be list-item and its going to save that 
    tag there your going to have an array of objects which you are going to transverse through
    
    The second thing that we are learning here is about getElementByTagName and here the thing 
    that we need to know is that its going to refer to the tag and its going to show HTMLCollection
-->

<!-- 
    const listItems_one = document.querySelector(".list-item");
    console.log(listItems_one);

    const listItems_all = document.querySelectorAll(".list-item");
    console.log(listItems_all);

    So here something new that I learned was that when it comes to querySelectors there is 
    querySelector and querySelectorAll and the thing to know here is that the all is going to 
    be selecting all the occurences of the class and then the querySelector is going for each 
    occuerence in liner form. 
-->

<!-- 

    listItem = document.querySelectorAll("ul > li:last-child");
    console.log(listItem);

    So here something new that I learned was that we can use querySelectorAll and then 
    chose the unordered list and we can do li:last-child and what this does is that its 
    going to be selecting the last list item 
-->

<!-- Static vs Live

    <div class="allDiv">First Div</div>
    <script>
        const allDiv = document.getElementsByClassName("allDiv");
        console.log(allDiv);
    </script>
    <div class="allDiv">Second Div</div>
    
    console.log(allDiv);

    So here there is something important to understand here and that being we created the first div 
    with a class called allDiv and they are two of the same here in the script its important to 
    understand that we are going to be using the getElementByClassName and this is going to be looking 
    for the class "allDiv" the important thing to understand here is that when using getElementByClassName 
    its going to understand one div at a time so when we run the first console.log its going to see only 
    one node and when it comes to the other run in the later script its then going to see another node so 
    meaning that its a very tedious thing to run each time that is something to be aware of here 

    <div class="allDiv">First Div</div>
    <script>
      const allDiv = document.querySelectorAll(".allDiv");
      console.log(allDiv);
    </script>
    <div class="allDiv">Second Div</div>

    console.log(allDiv);

    So here the new thing that I learned when it comes to working with querySelectorAll what this 
    does is that it stores one instance at a time meaning that each time its going to refer to the 
    same one that is something to be aware of here what I had thought was that it was going to be 
    referring one to all rather it was one to one.
-->

<!--  
    <ul id="element" data="valid">

    console.log(element.getAttribute("data"));
    console.log(element.setAttribute("order-placed", "pending"));
    console.log(element.removeAttribute("order-placed"));
    console.log(element.hasAttribute("order-placed"));
    console.log(element.attributes);

    So here there is something new that I learned and that being that we can pass in 
    an attribute using the id so notice that we are running these methods on the element 
    which in this case is the id and we are cross referencing it and checking if certain 
    attributes exist or not and if they do
-->

<!-- 
    
    Create and Removing and Updating node elements
    
    const newDiv = document.createElement("div");
    body.append(newDiv);
    
    So here there is something new that I learned and that being that we
    are creating a node something to be aware of here is we are using the 
    createElement and the way we are going to be doing this is by creating a 
    variable and then using document then createElement and then the element 
    name or new node and all we are doing is appending the newDiv to main body 
    node using the append this was something cool to learn.

    const newDiv = document.createElement("div");
    
    const newText = document.createTextNode("Hello World");
    newDiv.appendChild(newText);
    
    body.append(newDiv);

    So here the two middle lines are basically going to doing the DOM Manip.
    and the thing to know here is that this is basically DOM changing and it shows how 
    useful this thing can be we store a new text and then just add to the dom rather then going 
    back to the HTML and then making changes from there that is something to be aware of here.

<!-- 
    Events

    <button id="clickBtn" onclick="alert('Hello World')">Click Me</button>

    clickBtn.onclick = function () {
        alert("Thanks for clicking!");
    };
    
    So here lets examine what is going on the first thing that we need to know is that we are 
    going to be creating a button and in it we are passing a button id and that is called clickBtn
    and in that we are passing onclick something that came to my attention here was this that 
    notice we are passing alert("helloWorld") now onclick means that once the user were to click 
    here then this will happen and alert is JS where it alerts you the next thing that we are 
    going to be doing is using the id and then using onclick and then we are going to be running the 
    function that is called alert() and this is going to be using the id then onclick and then the function
    that we defined.
-->

<!-- 
    Pass Vs Call Function 

    <button id="clickBtn">Click Me</button>

    function callMe() {
        alert("Thanks Fam!");
    }
    
    clickBtn.onclick = callMe;

    So here we are learning between call and pass the first thing that we need to know is that we 
    created a button with an id of clickBtn and we then created a function called callMe() and 
    in it we are going to be passing the alert function and inside it we are going to pass the 
    string "Thanks fam!" now we are using the id attribute and what this does is that we then run 
    the onclick on it and when we click the button then its going to callMe so my theory here is this 
    that when we pass in with the () this is going to fire the function and get the result and pass that 
    in and when we pass a reference to the function we are going to be passing the function when we click and 
    what this does is that it then runs the function and it gets a delayed response not an immediate response
-->

<!-- 
    Events
    
    clickBtn.onclick = function () {
        alert("Thanks for clicking!");
    };

    function callMe() {
        alert("Thanks Fam!");
    }

    clickBtn.onclick = callMe;

    clickBtn.onclick = function () {
        alert("Thanks for clicking");
    };

    Add event listeners

    clickBtn.addEventListener("click", callMe);
    
    clickBtn.addEventListener("click", function () {
        alert("Thanks for clicking");
    });

    So here we are learning something powerful and that being addEventListener the first thing that we need to know 
    is that we are using the id and then using the onclick event and creating a function that is going to be alert function
    the second thing that we are going to be doing is creating a function called callMe and in it we are passing in the alert 
    function with its different message we are passing in the function to the onclick event to the clickBtn the second thing 
    that we are going to do be doing is that clickBtn and adding event listener that is going to be running a function called 
    the alert with its different message we are passing in the function to the onclick event and lastly we are using the addEventListener
    and the thing to know about it is the first part is going to be what should take place and the second part should be what should 
    happen when so and so takes place and lets examine the next part and its going to be doing everything we did earlier in one line 
    the other thing that we need to know here is this that when it comes to using these onclicks what usually ends up happening is that 
    the more we use them they don't repeat so thats why we also use event listeners so that we can rerun the same function over and over 
    again.
